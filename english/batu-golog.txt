Batu Golog (Golog Stone)

A story from West Nusa Tenggara

A long time ago, there lived a poor family in Padamara near Sawing River, West Nusa Tenggara. They worked as agricultural laborers. The husband was named Amaq Lembain, and his wife was named Inaq Lembain. They had two sons. The sons would come with their mother every time she pounded rice.

One day, Inaq Lembain went pounding rice as usual. Her sons sat on a big rock near her. When Inaq started pounding, the rocks they sat on began to rise. 

The eldest son calling his mother, “Mom, this stone is getting higher." 

But Inaq was busy working. She said, "My son, wait a minute. I have just started pounding.”

That happened repeatedly, until the rock grew taller than palm trees. The boys shouted louder until their voice became faint. When the rock reached the clouds, the boys cried loudly. 

In time, Inaq realized that her sons were gone. Her sons were brought by the Golog Stone. She cried and prayed for her sons to come back. Then, suddenly, with her belt, she cut the rock. 

The rock was broken into three parts. The first part fell in a place named Desa Gembong because it made the earth tremble. The second part fell in a place named Dasan Batu because someone saw the falling part. The last part fell in a place named Montong Teker because it caused a rumbling sound.

However, her sons did not come back to earth. They were transformed into birds. The elder son was transformed into a Kekuwo bird, and the younger son was transformed into a Kelik bird. Both birds did not incubate their eggs.
